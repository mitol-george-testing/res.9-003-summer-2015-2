description: How do we recognize the source of a sound texture, such as the sound
  of insects or waves? Josh McDermott and colleagues propose a model of this process
  that uses statistics of the frequency content of the sounds, and the modulation
  of this content over time, depicted in these spectrograms (bottom) and plots of
  modulation power (top).
