description: "Josh Tenenbaum and colleagues propose that our intuitions about properties\
  \ like the stability of a stack of blocks, may derive from \u201Cprobabilistic programs\u201D\
  \ that can simulate, with some uncertainty, the physics that governs how objects\
  \ behave in space and time. Such programs can be implemented and tested using probabilistic\
  \ programming languages such as the Church language."
