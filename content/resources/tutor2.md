description: "One MATLAB\xAE tutorial exercise explores how the retinal image (upper\
  \ left) is processed by neurons in the early stages of the visual pathway. This\
  \ processing can be modeled as convolution with spatial filters that incorporate\
  \ Gaussian smoothing (upper right). The result of retinal processing can be described\
  \ as convolution with the difference of two Gaussians that form a center-surround\
  \ spatial structure (lower left). The spatial receptive fields of neurons in visual\
  \ cortex can be described as an oriented Gabor filter, producing results such as\
  \ that shown for an oblique orientation in the lower right."
