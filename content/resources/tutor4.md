description: In experiments by Zhang et al. (2011), monkeys viewed images depicting
  different classes of objects while researchers measured the neural signals generated
  for each image in an area of the brain known as IT cortex. These signals were later
  decoded to determine the particular object class that was viewed. This figure shows
  a confusion matrix that captures how well the class predicted by the decoding model
  matches the true object class that was viewed.
