description: "Josh Tenenbaum and colleagues propose that our intuitions about properties\
  \ like the stability of a stack of objects, may derive from \u201Cprobabilistic\
  \ programs\u201D in our heads that can simulate, with some uncertainty, the physics\
  \ that governs how objects behave in space and time. Aspects of these programs are\
  \ learned from infancy, as a child interacts with the world."
