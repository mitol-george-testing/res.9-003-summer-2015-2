Tutorial Overview
-----------------

| ![Sequence of four images of a coin, with progressively less detail and resolution.](/resources/res-9-003-brains-minds-and-machines-summer-course-summer-2015/tutorials/tutorial-2.-matlab-programming/tutor2.jpg) | One MATLAB® tutorial exercise explores how the retinal image (upper left) is processed by neurons in the early stages of the visual pathway. This processing can be modeled as convolution with spatial filters that incorporate Gaussian smoothing (upper right). The result of retinal processing can be described as convolution with the difference of two Gaussians that form a center-surround spatial structure (lower left). The spatial receptive fields of neurons in visual cortex can be described as an oriented Gabor filter, producing results such as that shown for an oblique orientation in the lower right. 

MATLAB is a powerful technical computing environment that is used extensively in the research described in this course. MATLAB programs are used, for example, to conduct experiments and gather data, analyze and visualize data, and implement computational models. This tutorial is intended for students who already have computer programming background and want to learn some of the basic elements of the MATLAB language and how it can be applied to sample problems in computational neuroscience.

### Useful Background

*   Introduction to computer programming, linear algebra
*   The MATLAB technical computing environment can be purchased from [MathWorks, Inc](http://www.mathworks.com/).
*   The free [GNU Octave Scientific Programming Language](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is largely compatible with MATLAB and can be used to run the MATLAB examples in this tutorial.

### MATLAB Introduction

*   The tutorial document below, which was originally prepared by Mark Goldman (UC Davis) and extended by Daniel Zysman (MIT), provides an introduction to aspects of MATLAB that are used in the programming exercises provided in this tutorial.
