Course Schedule
---------------

Following a short introduction, the lectures are organized into 9 units that include lectures by course instructors and guest speakers. Some units also include a panel or debate. Tutorials on useful background topics appear at the end of the table. Although the sessions are listed in the table in a particular order, the units and their component lectures are somewhat independent, providing the flexibility to explore topics in a different order.

Session Key
-----------

L = Lecture by course instructor

S = Seminar by guest speaker

T = Tutorial by course instructor or TA

P = Panel discussion

D = Debate

See the [Instructors]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/syllabus/course-instructors-guest-speakers-and-icub-team) page for a list of each instructor's institutional and department affiliation.
